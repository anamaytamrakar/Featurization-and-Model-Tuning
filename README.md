# Featurization-and-Model-Tuning

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. 
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. 
These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

## Objective:
Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning
