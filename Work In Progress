## Observations:
1 - Missed to give the detailed inference for EDA, feature selection and feature engineering, Model Building & output. 
2 - Diagonals Analysis:The diagonal gives the same information, we got using distplot. 
3 - Cement attribute have almost normal curve. 
4 - Slag has two gausssians and rightly skewed. It shows the presence of outliers. 
5 - ash has two gaussians and rightly skewed. It shows the presence of outliers.
6 - water has atleast 2 guassians and slightly left skewed.It shows the presence of outliers. 
7 - superplastic has multiple gaussians and rightly skewed.It shows the presence of outliers. 
8 - coarseagg has three guassians and almost normal. 
9 - fineagg has almost two guassians and looks like normal. 
10 - age has multiple guassians and rightly skewed. It shows the presence of outliers. 
11 - strength is close to a normal curve. 
12 - We not only have missing values problem but also outliers problem in the dataset. 
13 - Off Diagonal Analysis: Relationship between indpendent attributes. Scatter plots cement vs other independent attributes: 
    This attribute does not have any significant relation with slag, ash, water, superplatic, coarseagg,fineagg and age. 
    It almost spread like a cloud. If we had calculated the r value it would have come close to 0. 
14 - slag vs other independent attributes: 
    This attribute also does not have any significant relation with ash, water, superplatic, coarseagg,fineagg and age. 
    It almost spread like a cloud. If we had calculated the r value it would have come close to 0. 
15 - ash vs other independent attributes: 
    This attribute also does not have any significant relation with water, superplatic, coarseagg,fineagg and age. 
    It almost spread like a cloud. If we had calculated the r value it would have come close to 0. 
16 - Water vs other independent attributes: 
     This attribute have negative linear relationship with superplastic and fineagg. 
     It does not have any significant relationship with other independent atributes. 
     This is true as Superplasticizers allows the reduction of water in the concrete upto the extent of 30% without reducing the workability. 
17 - Superplastic vs other independent attributes:
     This attribute have negative linear relationship with water only. 
     It does not have any significant relationship with other independent attributes. 
18 - coarseagg vs other independent attributes:
     This attribute also does not have any significant relation with any other attributes. 
     It almost spread like a cloud. If we had calculated the r value it would have come close to 0. 
19 - fineagg vs other independent attributes:
     It has negative linear relationship with water. 
     It does not have any significant relation with any other attributes. 
     It almost spread like a cloud. If we had calculated the r value it would have come close to 0. 
20 - The reason why we are doing all this analysis is if we find any kind of dimensions which are very strongly correlated 
     i.e. r value close to 1 or -1 such dimensions are giving same information to your algorithms, its a redundant dimension. 
## Improvements
     So in such cases we may want to keep one and drop the other which we should keep and which we should drop depends on 
     again your domain expertise, which one of the dimension is more prone to errors. I would like to drop that dimension. 
     Or we have a choice to combine these dimensions and create a composite dimension out of it. 
     strength attribute : Relationship between dependent and independent attributes 
     strength: Now its comparing the target column with all other independent attributes and its showing us very vital information. 
     strength vs cement: It is linearly related to the cement. 
     The relationship is positive and we can see that for a given value of cement we have a multiple values of strength. 
     Which one should we pick we don't know. 
     Hence Cement though it has positive relationship with the strength, it is not a very good predictor. It is a weak predictor. 
     strength vs slag: There is no particular trend. 
     strength vs age: For a given value of age, we have different values of strength. Hence, It is not a good predictor. 
     strength vs superplastic: Other attributes does not give any strong relationship with strength. 
     Hence, we can see that none of the independent attributes are a good predictors of the strength attribute. 
     There is a no linear relationship between them.
     So, we will not use Linear model
